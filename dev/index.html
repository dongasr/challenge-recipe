			<h2>What is the Creative Coding Puzzle Recipe?</h2>
			<p>The creative coding puzzle recipe is a set of instructions for you, the puzzle creator, to use as a guide as you create your puzzle.<br>Don’t worry if you don’t understand how to do this yet, the recipe will take you carefully through each step.<br>It’s a chance to get your designs into the real world so do your best and enjoy exploring this facinating guide on education design for creative coding.<br>If your puzzle is fun, well suited to your chosen topic and keeps learners alert and focused, the teaching team will integrate it into the design programming course next semester!</p>
		</section>
		<section id="s1">
			<h2>Step 1: Choose a Topic</h2>
			<p>In this step we'll be:</p>
			<ul class="dotted-list">
				<li>Choosing a code topic as the theme for your puzzle.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Below is a list of topics that are taught in the design programming course that need puzzles.<br>Choose a topic for your puzzle on from the list below.</p>
			<p><strong>Week 3 Concepts</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#">The Random Method</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Sin and Cos Methods</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">The Easing Principle</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Week 4 Concepts</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#">Manipulating Functions</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Week 5 Concepts</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#">Transforming Shapes</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Week 6 Concepts</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#">Creating Arrays</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Week 7 Concepts</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#">Blending Images</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p><em>Hint: If you’re not sure what to choose, think about a time that one of these topics just ‘clicked’ and explore why that happened. Some people learning p5.js for the first time will probably feel the same way so you can make a puzzle about that!</em></p>
		</section>
		<section id="s2">
			<h2>Step 2: Write your puzzle goal</h2>
			<p>In this step we'll be:</p>
			<ul class="dotted-list">
				<li>Writing a goal that indicates when the learner has completed the puzzle.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now it’s time to clearly define your puzzle goal. This is pretty simple because all puzzle goals will sound quite similar; it’s just a way to keep learners focused on a task.</p>
			<p>Here are some example puzzle goals sorted the topic a puzzle might involve:</p>
			<table style="width:100%">
			 <tr>
				 <th>Topic</th>
				 <th>Puzzle Goal</th>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				 <td>Tranforming Shapes</td>
				 <td>Through the successful completion of this puzzle, you will have a greater practical understanding of using various transformation methods to reach a solution.</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				 <td>The Random Method</td>
				 <td>Through the successful completion of this puzzle, you will have a greater practical understanding of using randomness to create a visual outcome with a solution in mind.</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				 <td>Working with Images</td>
				 <td>Through the successful completion of this puzzle, you will have a greater practical understanding of how to include and manipulate images to reach a solution.</td>
			 </tr>
			</table>

			<p>One thing it’s important to keep in mind is that a puzzle always has a solution as opposed to designing with code which can be artistic expression without a single solution.</p>
			<table style="width:100%">
			 <tr>
				 <th>Type of challenge</th>
				 <th><center>A solution</center></th>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				 <td>Creative Coding Puzzle</td>
				 <td><center><img src="images/tick.svg" alt="Tick - there is a solution" height="20px"></center></td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				 <td>Designing with Code</td>
				 <td><center><img src="images/cross.svg" alt="Cross - there is not a solution" height="20px"></center></td>
			 </tr>
			</table>

			<p>With these resources as a guide, write your own puzzle goal.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="s3">
			<h2>Step 3: Sketch your puzzle</h2>
			<p>In this step we'll be:</p>
			<ul class="dotted-list">
				<li>Sketching what your puzzle looks like.</li>
				<li>Creating a process flow of how your puzzle will work.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By sketching the puzzle, you can visualise what the puzzle looks like in two states: when it’s unsovled and when it’s solved. You can sketch it, write it out with diagrams or even mock up in illustrator! just make sure to have something visual you can refer to.<br><br>

The reason we’re doing this is to create a clear aim in step 4 where you code your puzzle and figure out what the steps are to get from an unsolved to a solved puzzle.<br><br>

<em>Hint: If you’re not sure how to get started, look for inspiration! consider patterns in nature, artisitcs influences or perhaps some code projects on YouTube or GitHub. Whatever you choose think about it in terms that Scott puts forward; is there a clear problem to solve and is it fun?</em></p>

			<h2>Step 4: Code your puzzle and think aloud</h2>
			<p>In this step we'll be:</p>
			<ul class="dotted-list">
				<li>Develop your puzzle in p5.js</li>
				<li>Think aloud to create a process flow from an unsolved to solved puzzle</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Using your sketch as a guide develop your puzzle in p5.js creating two JavaScript files. One where the puzzle is unsolved. Another where the puzzle is solved.<br><br>

					Check out these examples below. First up we've got an example process flow.

			</figure>
			<p>And here we have some code editors that show the difference between a solved and an unsolved puzzle.</p>

			<section id="s5">
				<h2>Step 5: Write your intro steps</h2>
				<p>In this step we'll be:</p>
				<ul class="dotted-list">
					<li>Writing the copy for how you introduce your puzzle and the tasks for the learner.</li>
					<li>Write how the learner can get familiar with the code structure.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Like a story, your puzzle needs a beginning, middle and end. The intro steps are the beginning. They help the learner understand the what they need to do, how to get there and get their head around how the code works.<br><br>

Check out this <a href="#" target="_blank">example</a> on what intro steps might look like for a puzzle on transforming shapes.<br><br>

Write your steps on a word document we can worry about the design later when you’re puzzle process is fully written.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="s6">
				<h2>Step 6: Develop your explore steps</h2>
				<p>In this step we'll be:</p>
				<ul class="dotted-list">
					<li>Developing code examples that visually explain the mechanics of your puzzle</li>
					<li>Considering how the learner can interact with your mechanic examples.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To help your learner visualise how they can manipulate their unsolved puzzle to create a solved puzzle, let’s give them some examples of how the code mechanics work.
					You need to find a balance between making the puzzle too hard to solve and giving the puzzle away.<br>
					You can use your process flow from step 4 as a guide on how to do this.<br>
					Below are some examples of how you might do this for a puzzle on transforming shapes.<br><br>

					Use them as a guide to develop your own explore steps for your puzzle

			<section id="s7">
				<h2>Step 7: Write your puzzle step</h2>
				<p>In this step we'll be:</p>
				<ul class="dotted-list">
					<li>Writing the step asking the learner to get from the unsolved to solved puzzle</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The learner should get to this step having some ideas of how to solve the puzzle. Now all you’re doing is asking them to do it and providing a code editor in which to do it.<br><br>

					Here's an <a href="#">example of a puzzle step</a> Now create one for your puzzle
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="s8">
				<h2>Step 8: Raid the component library</h2>
				<p>In this step we'll be:</p>
				<ul class="dotted-list">
					<li>Turning our steps into web components</li>
					<li>Considering their design/use and jotting down notes to prepare for Step 9</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Now that you’ve got your steps written out, it’s time to convert them into web components. you can find these in the component library It’s your job to use them appropriately to make an experience that keeps the puzzle fun and the learner alert and focused. Feel free to use them as a starting point for your own designs if you have a great idea that helps you reach your puzzles goals from <a href="">Step 2</a><br><br>

					Here's a link to the <a href="#">component library</a>. Head there and turn your steps into the web components available or design your own!.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="s9">
				<h2>Step 9: Justify your design</h2>
				<p>In this step we'll be:</p>
				<ul class="dotted-list">
					<li>Writing documentation that explains and justifies your design</li>
					<li>Reflecting on and iterating our puzzle according to the rubric</li>
				</ul>
				<p>With your puzzle made into a web page, you can review your design choices guided by the rubric. Keep your puzzle goal in mind but remember, you’re getting marked according to the rubric.<br>
Talk to your friends, peers and the tutors about how you could improve your puzzle; getting feedback is an important part of the design process.<br><br>

Congratulations on reaching the end of the recipe and creating a puzzle. It might be the one that makes a fellow designer fall in love with code!</p>
