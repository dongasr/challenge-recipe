      <h2>Write your learning goal and puzzle trick</h2>
      <p>Before we dive into building a webpage, let's talk about what makes a good challenge: all good challenges involve a puzzle.<br><br>

        Puzzles give us a sense of play, imply a sense of control over an environment and focus our attention to solve a logical problem. When you figure out how to solve a puzzle, you've essentially learnt something. This is why we're making puzzles in our challenges.<br><br>

        A good puzzle needs you to learn something in order to solve it. So we will need two things to get started: a learning goal and a puzzle trick.</p>
      <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
          <!-- FEEDBACK -->
          <!-- have this be on one line and give it some padding -->
          <th>Learning goal</th>
          <td>What you want the students to learn by solving the puzzle.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Puzzle Trick</th>
          <td>The logical problem students need to figure out to solve a logical problem. e.g. the algorithms to solve a rubix cube depending on the current configuration.</td>
        </tr>

      <p>Using those definitions as a guide, write the learning goal and puzzle trick for your puzzle. If you're stuck, check out this video where Scott Kim, Puzzlemaster, talks about different examples of puzzles.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>Now that you have a learning goal and a puzzle trick, it's time to think about your puzzle from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design" target="_blank">human centred design</a> perspective. Your target user is a Design Programming student. Think about making a puzzle for you and your friends 6 months ago. <br><br>

				With our target user in mind, it's time to sketch the puzzle. You’re figuring out you want the complete puzzle to look like.<br><br>

        When visualising your puzzle, consider patterns in nature, artistic influences or code projects on YouTube or GitHub as inspiration. To check if you’re on the right track think about it in the terms that Scott (the puzzle-master from the <a href="#s2">previous step</a>) puts forward; is there a clear
        problem to solve and is it fun?<br><br>

        Continuing on with our <a href="./example-challenge.html#wel" target="_blank">example</a> on transforming shapes, check out this sketch below thinking about the puzzle from the student’s perspective.<br><br>

      Remember, our student's goal is to <em>"understand how translate and rotate affect how shapes are drawn on the canvas."</em>. They'll do this by figuring out the puzzle trick (outlined in the <a href="#s2">previous step</a>). The sketch below is our idea for what the code will look when it's been solved by the student.</p>

      <h2>Work out your algorithm</h2>
      <p>We've just sketched out what our puzzle will look like. But before we can figure out how the student will solve the puzzle, we need to figure how the code will work for ourselves!<br><br> It might help to break down how it's going to work in a diagram before you go and develop it. Before you can teach this, you have to have working code for your solved puzzle. After you've got it working we can break it down into learnable steps.<br><br>

        Using your sketch as a guide, work out how the instructions you give the computer in p5.js will create your solved puzzle. This is to break down the code process and keep track of the steps you take to get to the solved puzzle.<br><br>

        You can do this is by writing a code process flow. Below is an example of a code process flow for our <a href="./example-challenge.html#wel" target="_blank">example challenge</a> on transforming shapes.</p>
      <figure class="img-container">
        <!-- link: https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/024-perlinnoiseflowfield.html-->
        <img src="images/step-4-img-2.jpg" alt="an example of code process flow" width="100%">
        <figcaption>
          <center>Here’s an example of code process flow<center>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This is a process flow for our windmill challenge<br><br>

        This first box says we need to 'make a blade' and we think the best method to use would be beginShape(). It's also mentioned we might need to put this inside a custom function for later.<br><br>

        The second box says we need to 'make 6 blades' and we think a for loop will be the easiest way to do that. It also says we need to iterate the blade code 6 times to make enough blades for our windmill.<br><br>

        The third box says we need to 'rotate 6 blades' and we think adding an 'r' argument to our custom function will make it easy to rotate each blade the right amount by iterating the 'r' value in a for loop and then using 'r' as the value in the rotate method.<br><br>

        The fourth box says we need to 'translate 6 blades' and we think adding 'x' and 'y' arguments to the custom function will, like with 'r', make it easy to move each blade on the screen the right amount. This time, instead of the rotate method, we'll put 'x' and 'y' in the translate() method.<br><br>

        The final box says we have an extra challenge 'blow on blades'. We think the p5.audioIn method would be the way to hook up the windmill to our mic. We've also said there needs to be a blownBreeze variable and a gentleBreeze variable to mimic how regular wind and someone blowing on a windmill (if they had enough breath!) would combine to make the windmill move. Then, it says the blownBreeze variable would be the mic amplitude and the gentleBreeze variable would use a counter to remain steady.<br><br>

        Woah! that was a lot of reading! Good job for sticking with it 😉.<br><br>

        Now work out the process flow for your puzzle.<br><br>

        Logical problems are bound to come up when writing code. You can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging" target="_blank">rubber duck code method</a> to think through them..<br><br>

      <h2>Design your puzzle pieces</h2>
      <p>So you’ve just written the code for your puzzle like the fantastic puzzle designer you are! Now you need to break it down into learnable steps so the student can learn something by solving the puzzle.<br><br>

        The way you break down these steps won't be the same as how you worked out your algorithm. You wrote that for someone who already knew how to code it from scratch i.e. you!<br><br>

				Now you're writing it for a less experienced student; someone who doesn't understand the code yet but will learn by solving your puzzle. Think what kind of puzzle pieces you’d want to start with if you were doing the challenge as a Design Programming student. Always keep your target user in mind.<br><br>

        Don't worry if this is confusing. Human Centred Design is like that for everyone at the start!<br><br>

			Below are some example puzzle pieces with their example challenges linked. Use them to think how you can break your puzzle into learnable steps<br><br>
		Create your own puzzle pieces in the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5 code editor</a>. Don’t forget to save it to your account for later use!<br><br>

  So the puzzle piece below is all about rotation. For the transforming shapes example, it seemed easiest to break up the steps by method i.e. rotation and translation. The user can mess around with rotation via mouseX. This way, they can see that as the value of rotation changes, the blade rotates. there's also a red dot and lines (debug markers) to represent the origin and orientation of the canvas that the blade sits in (weird canvas in a canvas inception) feel free to use this debug idea in your puzzle pieces!</p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Similar to the previous piece, this puzzle piece allows the user to visualise how values affect translation. note we've used mouseY as well this time to aid in visualisation. Consider how you could use interaction for your puzzle pieces?</p>

Since the learning goal is understanding how to manipulate lines in for loops across multiple directions, the puzzle breaks down that concept and builds through user up in difficulty in the same method.</p>

      <p>This final example is that building principle we mentioned before, starting with a simple task in the puzzle and the next task on top of it. What do you think the best way is to build your puzzle pieces?</p>

      <h2>Write your challenge instructions</h2>
      <p>Now you’ve figured out what your puzzle pieces are, it's time to write the instructions you'll give your students so they understand what they need to do to complete their challenge.<br><br>

        Remember, this isn't just giving your student the puzzle and telling them to solve it. You need to make sure that the understand what they need to do at each section of your challenge.<br><br>

        You need to help them understand what they need to do without giving the puzzle away.<br><br>

        To do this write out your instructions in a word document. See if you can mimic the writing style in the <a href="./example-challenge.html#wel" target="_blank">example challenge</a> i.e. splitting the challenge into sections, using titles for sections and providing a clear action for each section with support visual references.<br><br>

        Create your jumbled puzzle in the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5 code editor</a>. Don’t forget to save it to your GitHub account for later use!</p>

      <p>With all the things you’ve previously designed, you’re ready to build a webpage using components from the component library!<br><br>

        Check out <a href="./example-challenge.html" target="_blank">this example</a> challenge on transforming shapes to guide how you might write your challenge. Note how each step that we pointed out in the puzzle pieces has it's own step with it's own instructions.<br><br>

        Use the code from the <a href="./component-library.html" target="_blank">component library</a> to build your webpage.

      <h2>Write your design justification</h2>
      <p>Now that you’ve made your web page you need to justify your design. Go back through each step and reflect on why you think the decisions you made were good design choices. Then compile these reflections into your documentation according to
        the <a href="" target="_blank">rubric</a>.<br><br>

        Congratulations on reaching the end of the recipe and creating a puzzle. We hope that helping us teach programming has helped you learn more about it and get new students to fall in love with code!
