			<h2>What is the Challenge Recipe?</h2>
			<p>As part of Web Design and Technologies, you’ve been asked to create a web page.<br>
This webpage needs to give students of creative coding a challenge that helps them become better programmers. The Challenge Recipe, is a guide for how to do that.<br><br>

The teaching team wants to include great challenges in next semester’s design programming course. So do your best and your work might go on to teach new creative coders. Enjoy making your challenge!
			</p>

		<section id="s1">
			<h2>Step 1: Your Topic</h2>
			<p>Here are the topics we teach in Design Programming that could benefit from additional challenges.<br>
Choose one as the topic for your challenge.</p>
			<table style="width:100%">
			 <tr>
				 <td><a href="https://designprogramming.io/session3#slide=4" target="_blank">Random</a></td>
				 <td>understand and use random floating-points.</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				 <td><a href="https://designprogramming.io/session3#slide=17" target="_blank">Sin and Cos</a></td>
				 <td>mapping values to the sine and cos waves</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				 <td><a href="https://designprogramming.io/session3#slide=14" target="_blank">Easing</a></td>
				 <td>smooth transitions between two values.</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				 <td><a href="https://designprogramming.io/session4#slide=3" target="_blank">Functions</a></td>
				 <td>create sets of statements that perform a task.</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				 <td><a href="https://designprogramming.io/session5#slide=3" target="_blank">Transformation</a></td>
				 <td>manipulate the canvas origin and orientation.</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				 <td><a href="https://designprogramming.io/session6#slide=3" target="_blank">Arrays</a></td>
				 <td>create lists-like objects that code can traverse and mutate.</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				 <td><a href="https://designprogramming.io/session7#slide=3" target="_blank">Images</a></td>
				 <td>represent .pngs, .gifs and .jpgs in the canvas.</td>
			 </tr>
			</table>
			<p>Think about a time when you were working on some code and one of these topics just ‘clicked’ for you. Alternatively, think about what would have helped you understand something you really struggled with.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="s2">
			<h2>Step 2: Your learning goal and puzzle trick</h2>
			<p>All good challenges are puzzles. they make you think about and understand the mechanics of a logical problem. your challenge will be centred around a puzzle.<br>
To get started, let’s define two things: your learning goal and your puzzle trick.<br>
The learning goal is what the user will get out of your challenge. The puzzle trick is the logical riddle a user has to solve to complete your puzzle.<br><br>

Here’s an example learning goal and puzzle trick for a puzzle on<em>Transforming Shapes:</em></p>
			<table style="width:100%">
			 <tr>
				 <td>Learning goal</td>
				 <td>Understand how translate and rotate affect the canvas and how shapes are drawn.</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				 <td>Puzzle Trick</td>
				 <td>together, rotate() and translate() position and orientate the canvas to any part of the screen. You draw one blade of the windmill, set the origin to the middle of the screen and then use rotate() to iterate the canvas orientation every time a for loop runs</td>
			 </tr>
			</table>
			<p>Check out this video where Scott Kim, Puzzlemaster, talks about different examples of puzzles. It’ll help you to define your puzzle goal and trick.</p>

			<p>With these resources as a guide, write your own puzzle goal.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="s3">
			<h2>Step 3: Your Puzzle Sketch</h2>
			<p>To understand what your puzzle will look like, sketch out what will be on the canvas before it’s solved and after it’s solved. Breaking it up like this will make it easier to see how the user will solve your puzzle using code.<br><br>

When visualising your puzzle, consider patterns in nature, artisitcs influences or code projects on YouTube or GitHub as inspiration. Whatever you choose, think about it in the terms that Scott puts forward; is there a clear problem to solve and is it fun?</p>

			<h2>Step 4: Your code process flow</h2>
			<p>Using your sketch as a guide, develop your puzzle in p5.js. Keep track how you created it and the p5 methods used however you like; a popular method used by developers is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging" target="_blank">rubber duck code.</a><br><br>

Below is an example of rubber duck code that was used to create a code process flow for our example challenge on <em>transforming shapes</em></p>

				<h2>Step 5: Your puzzle pieces</h2>
				<p>Using your code process flow, create puzzle pieces for the p5.js methods you think the user will need solve the puzzle.<br><br>

Check out the example puzzle pieces below for our puzzle on transforming shapes.<br><br>

Create your own puzzle pieces in the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5 code editor</a>. Don’t forget to save it to your account for later use!</p>

				</figure>
			</section>
			<section id="s6">
				<h2>Step 6: Your call to action</h2>
					<p>Now that you’ve made your puzzle pieces, you need to ask your user so solve the puzzle! Give the user a version of your solved puzzle that’s a bit jumbled and a visualisation of what they’re aiming for.
Only give the user code to do that helps them understand the topic.<br><br>

Below is an example code editor for the call to action in our puzzle on transforming shapes<br><br>

Create your own call to action in the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5 code editor</a>. Don’t forget to save it to your GitHub account for later use!</p>

				<h2>Step 7: Your Webpage</h2>
				<p>With all the things you’ve previously designed, you’re ready to build a webpage using components from the component library!<br><br>

Check out <a href="./example-challenge.html" target="_blank">this example</a> challenge on transforming shapes to guide how you might write your challenge.<br><br>

Use the code from the <a href="./component-library.html" target="_blank">component library</a> to build your webpage.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="s8">
				<h2>Step 8: Your design justification</h2>
				<p>Now that you’ve made your web page you need to justify your design. Go back through each step and reflect on why you think the decisions you made were good design choices. Then compile these reflections into your documentation according to the <a href="" target="_blank">rubric</a>.<br><br>

Congratulations on reaching the end of the recipe and creating a puzzle. We hope that helping us teach programming has helped you learn more about it and get new students to fall in love with code!
